# Team_16-CSE540-Supply_Chain_Provenance

A hybrid blockchain-based supply chain provenance system, combining on chain smart contracts, an off-chain event backend server to seed the index db, and a modern web frontend with react.js.

This project implements a three-layer architecture:

### 1.  Role-Based Access Control and Presentation and Backend (RBAC)
Access and permissions are strictly managed based on the participant's physical role in the supply chain:
* **Producers:** Initiate the digital provenance record by creating and registering new product batches.
* **Suppliers/Distributors:** Act as the logistics handlers, updating shipment statuses, splitting parent batches, and recording ownership transfers.
* **Retailers:** Represent the final commercial destination, verifying product authenticity upon receipt and updating inventory availability.
* **Consumers:** The end-users who utilize a read-only interface to verify the item details and tracking the history and origin.

### 2. The On-Chain Layer (Smart Contracts)
Acting as the immutable backend, this layer is programmed in **Solidity**. To minimize gas fees and optimize performance. It stores only lightweight data:
* Unique Product IDs (cryptographically generated to prevent counterfeiting)
* Parent Batch IDs (to maintain lineage during shipment splitting)
* Wallet addresses of current and past owners
* Cryptographic hashes (pointers) to external data

### 3. The Off-Chain Layer (Storage & Database)
To prevent network load, all "heavy" data—such as PDFs, and complex metadata—is stored off-chain using standard databases or decentralized file systems like **IPFS**. The system maintains tamper-proofing by mainting hash of those data in the block chain

### Code Organization

1. **On-Chain Layer (`blockchain/`)**  
	- Solidity smart contracts for supply chain provenance  
	- Hardhat for development, testing, and deployment
    - Mocha for unit testing

2. **Off-Chain Backend (`back-end/`)**  
	- Node.js service listens to blockchain events (e.g., `ProductRegistered`)  
	- Persists data to a database (Postgres)

3. **Presentation Layer (`front-end/`)**  
	- React-based UI for all roles (Admin, Producer, Distributor, Retailer, Consumer)  
	- Interacts with both the blockchain and the backend indexer



## Step-by-Step Setup/Run Instructions


### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v24.14.10 is recommended)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **MetaMask** browser extension (for blockchain interaction)
- **Postgres** (for backend database, if running locally)


#### How to install node v24.14.10 ?

1. Install NVM as mentioned: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
2. Install node veresion 24
```
$ nvm install v24.14.10

$ nvm use 24
Now using node v24.14.10

$ node -v
v24.14.10

```


### Block Chain Deployment
1. **Clone the repository**
	```sh
	git clone <repo-url>
	cd TeamName_CSE540_FinalProject
	```

2. **Change the diretory to blockchain**
    ```sh
    cd blockchain
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**
	```sh
	npm install
	```

4. **Start the local blockchain**
	```sh
	npx hardhat node
	```
5. **Run Tests**
    ```
    npm run test
    ```
6. **Deploy smart contract local** 
    ```
    npm run deploy-local
    ```


7. **Deploy smart contracts to Sepoli**

    ```sh
    # Create .env from the template


    cp .env.example .env


    # replace these placeholders with your credentials <YOUR_API_KEY> and <0xYOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY>
    # Never commit this file. This is already added to .gitignore

    npm run deploy

    ```


### Deployment/Execution backend event listener ###

1. **Change the diretory to back-end**
    ```sh
    cd back-end
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**
	```sh
	npm install
	```
3. **Run the backend**
	```sh
	npm run dev
	```

### Deployment/Execution Start the Front ###

1. **Change the diretory to front-end**
    ```sh
    cd front-end #
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**
	```sh
	npm install
	```
3. **Run the backend**
	```sh
	npm run dev
	```


**Access the app**  
	Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Notes

- Update `.env` files as needed for blockchain RPC URLs and database credentials.
- For production/testnet deployment, update network configs and use real endpoints.
